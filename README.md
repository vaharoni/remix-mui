# MUI <> Remix stack

This stack is based on:
https://github.com/mui/material-ui/tree/master/examples/remix-with-typescript

## How to use

```sh
npx create-remix@latest --template vaharoni/remix-mui
```

Install it and run:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

## The idea behind the stack

The project uses [Remix](https://remix.run/), which is a full stack web framework that lets you focus on the user interface and work back through web fundamentals to deliver a fast, slick, and resilient user experience.
It includes `@mui/material` and its peer dependencies, including `emotion`, the default style engine in MUI v5.
If you prefer, you can [use styled-components instead](https://mui.com/material-ui/guides/interoperability/#styled-components).

## What's next?

<!-- #default-branch-switch -->

You now have a working example project.
You can head back to the documentation, continuing browsing it from the [templates](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/templates/) section.
